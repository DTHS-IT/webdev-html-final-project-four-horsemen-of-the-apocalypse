<h2 class="history-headers">When Drama Started</h2>
<p>Before the Delcastle Players had a formal "Drama Club", there was the Theatre Arts Shop!<br>
The Theatre Arts Shop has the same purpose as the Drama Club it just didn't take place outside of school<br>
and you'd be able to make props and fully learn how to be a good actor during your shop hours. <br>
This program ended in the late 1990's and Drama Club took it's place.</p>

<h2 class="history-headers">How Long It's Been Running</h2>
<p>We don't know the exact year when Drama Club started, but factoring in the fact that it began after the Theatre Arts Shop<br>
was removed, a good estimate would be the Delcastle Player's Drama Club has been operating for at last 30 years!</p>
