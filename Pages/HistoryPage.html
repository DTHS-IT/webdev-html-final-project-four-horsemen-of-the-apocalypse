<h2 class="history-headers">When Drama Started...</h2>
<p>Before the Delcastle Players had a formal "Drama Club", there was the Theatre Arts Shop!<br>
The Theatre Arts Shop has the same purpose as the Drama Club it just didn't take place outside of school<br>
and you'd be able to make props and fully learn how to be a good actor during your shop hours. <br>
This program ended in the late 1990's and Drama Club took it's place.</p>

<h2 class="history-headers">How Long It's Been Running...</h2>
<p>We don't know the exact year when Drama Club started, <br>
    but considering the fact that it began after the Theatre Arts Shop was removed, <br>
a good estimate would be the Delcastle Player's Drama Club has been operating for at last 30 years!</p>

<h2 class="history-headers">Alumni Testimonials...</h2>
<p>     From Jorell Wallace, Alumni of Drama Club: <br>
        <em>"Drama Club was amazing to say the least, it was just so fun interacting and acting with everyone.<br>
        It was really like a family and I still talk to people from Drama Club now.<br>
        From when I joined in 10th grade<br>
        to when we had our last show "The Addams Family" in 12th grade, <br>
        We were really a family and all the love to Drama Club and Rob! ROB THE GOAT!"<br>
        (His Tiktok is @jrxnvy_, if you want to check him out)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        From Nick Carey, Tech Director of Drama Club:<br>
        <em>"The thing I enjoy most about Drama Club from a Director's perspective <br>
        is seeing the personal creativity of the students and the excitement <br>
        that they get when they are able to bring a scene to life. <br>
        Me and Rob both have the same philosophy of allowing our students to make the show their own, <br>
        so I enjoy doing what I can to help the students create a show that they're excited to bring to our audience."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        From Beatriz Quijada, Alumni of Drama Club:<br>
        <em>"I really enjoyed Drama Club during my time at Delcastle<br>
            I had been in it from freshman year all the way up until I graduated.<br>
            It was really fun and everyone was really close to each other.<br>
            I  got to enjoy my shop and Drama Club after school."</em>
